    "text": "Task 1: Set Up QGIS\nStep 1: Open QGIS on your laptop. Choose ‘blank project.’ Save the project with a file name that you can remember and location you can remember. Ex: Exercise1_Map.qgz\nWhen you first open QGIS you will notice a main map canvas. To the left of this map canvas are two windows Browser and Layers. The Layers panel is the best way to understand the order of data on the main map canvas and is the best way to change the data presentation (symbology) and access the data in tabular format. On the top the QGIS menu are a series of additional buttons which we will introduce throughout this lab and course. Finally, on the bottom are the details of the map canvas including the current center or selected coordinate, the map scale, rotation, and the coordinate reference system (CRS)\nStep 2: Set the project CRS. In BC, the provincial standard CRS is NAD83/BC Albers map projection (EPSG:3005). To set the projects CRS navigate to the bottom left of the window and click on the EPSG:4326 as shown below:\nSearch for EPSG:3005 and click apply and Ok.\nStep 3: Set up a ‘favorites’ folder to easily access the MKRF data. Right click on ‘Favorites’ and click add a directory. Navigate to the storage location for you MKRF data. Click ok\n\nBuilding Familiarity\nStep 4: Add P_Boundary_MKRF.gpkg to the map. From the browser window select the file and drag and drop into the main map. This will add the boundary MRKF as a polygon feature. This layer is shown in the main map and listed in ‘layers’ on the left-hand ‘layers’ panel.\nStep 5: Change the symbology of the boundary file by right clicking on P_Boundary_MKRF.gpkg in the layers pane. Select Properties. A window will pop-up. On the left-hand side the layer properties including: General, Source, Symbology, Labels, Fields, Joins, Diagrams. Select Symbology (The icon with the paintbrush). Keep the format as ‘single symbol.’ Change the layer to have a black outline with no fill by clicking on the icon ‘simple fill.’ Change the fill color to ‘transparent’ and the stroke width to ‘0.2’\nStep 6: Add L_streams_major.gkpg. In the ‘layers’ panel this will be the first, reflecting that this layer is above the boundary file. Change the color to something that represents streams (like.. blue?)\nStep 7: Navigate the around the map project by selecting the  icon. You can use the  to zoom and out.\nStep 8: Add the P_lakes.gpgk. Right-click on this layer in the layers panel and select Attribute Table. This gives details about the polygon features of the dataset. The shape area for each has been calculated in the ‘Shape_Area’ field.\n\n\nQuestion 1:\nHow many features (i.e. shapes) are in the P_lakes.gpkg?\n\n\nQuestion 2:\nWhere are the high versus low site indices relative to the terrain, relative to the north versus south, and relative to roads?"

    "text": "Task 2: Making a Site Index Map\nSite index is a measure of productivity. It is technically defined as: expected height (m) of the best trees (not damaged, biggest) of the dominant species at a reference age of 50 years breast height age. The site index reflects the potential of the site to grow this dominant species. Although this might also indicate how another species might do, this does not give a measure of the possible productivity of another species. For example, a site that is douglas-fir leading and has a high site index would not indicate that a species like whitebark pine (a high alpine species) would also do well. Also, if the soils change (e.g., landslides, fertilization, etc.) or the climate/hydrology changes, the site index might not be a good an indicator of the productivity for the historically dominant species. Importantly, for site index to be reported there have to be trees in the stand. In the MKRF dataset some recently harvested stands may show a “0” for site index, but this is really an NA.\nStep 1 Load P_ForestCover_1989.gpkg. Right click on the layer in the layers window and select Open Attribute Table. this will open an attribute table that describes the polygon components. Click on the the heading for SITEINDX to sort the table from smallest to largest site index. Many polygons have “0.0 m” for a site index value. Scroll right to the “non-forest descriptor” or NFD columbn. Here notes like “NSR” note sites that are “not-satisfactorily restocked, or there may be lakes. These are examples of polygons where there are no trees and thus no site-index value.\nStep 2 Click to the SITEINDX column heading again to sort from largest to smallest. See ?sec-Q3 to answer. Close the attribute table.\nStep 3 Right click on the P_ForestCover_1989 layer again in the layers panel and select Properties\n\nSelect Symbology and change the symbol from “single Symbol” to “Graduated”\nUnder Value click the small down arrow on the right to select the “SITEINDX” column.\nIn the Color ramp field click the small down arrow on the right to select the “Viridis” color palette\nAt the bottom of the symbology window, select Classify. This will classify the values in “SITEINDX” based on their values into different colors associated with the viridis color ramp.\nUnder Classify and Mode select “Equal Interval” and change the number of classes to “12”. Click Classify again.\nIn the Classes pain (the main white box) change these to 5 m classes as 0.00 to 0.00 (i.e., no site index), 0.05 to 5.05, 5.05 to 10.05, 10.05 to 15.05, etc.\nClick Apply and OK. The symbology window will close and you can now see your recolored layer\n\n\nStep 4 Create a site index map to export as a picture. ::: {#tip-mapmaking .callout-tip} check out this link for some useful resources on making maps in QGIS :::\n\nSelect Project -&gt; New Print out Layout.

    "text": "Task 5: Compare Changes Western Redcedar in 1999 to 1989\nIn this last brief task are some instructions for visualizing the point cloud and interpolated DEM surfaces in ArcGIS Pro. You can produce and export some 3D scenes that may help to illustrate your observations in your report.\nStep 1: In ArcGIS Pro, click the “Insert” tab, click and expand “New Map”, and select “New Local Scene”.\nStep 2: Add the “mkrf_aoi_lidar.las” file to the scene. Navigating an ArcGIS Pro scene is nearly the same as it is in QGIS. Though, instead of using keys on the keyboard to toggle between the different camera axes to manipulate, ArcGIS Pro provides an on-screen navigator in the bottom left. In this way, you can manipulate an ArcGIS Pro scene using just your mouse.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, ArcGIS Pro uses its own “WorldElevation3D/Terrain3D” source for the “Ground” in the Contents Pane. You can change the ground source to any DEM or really any other raster that you want to use the values of to create a “ground” surface. We are going to use this feature to explore the differences between the surface models we derived and the actual point cloud.\nStep 3: Add the three interpolated DEM rasters to the scene and also the difference rasters. Toggle everything off in the scene. Drag the three DEM rasters under “Ground”. Leave the three difference rasters under “2D Layers”.\nStep 4: For each difference raster, toggle it on and change the symbology to “Stretch”, using a diverging “Color Scheme” and a “Minimum Maximum” “Stretch Type”. Below in the “Statistics” tab, click “Dataset” and then select “Custom” from the drop-down menu. Modify the “Minimum” and “Maximum” values so that they are the same magnitude, but one is positive and the other is negative. You select the appropriate values based on the range of values that you observe in the difference raster and you will need to test different values to get your desired effect. For example, if the range of difference values is -10.51 and 21.32, then you might try setting the “Minimum” to -10 and the “Maximum” to 10. If you want the colors to be more apparent, then incrementally reduce the magnitude of your values: try -7, 7 next; then -5, 5; etc. until you reach your desired visualization. It it important to ensure that the midpoint is zero when using a diverging color scheme.\nStep 5: Toggle on each pair of DEM (under “Ground”) and difference raster (under “2D Layers”). The ground source adds elevation to the difference raster that you symbolized, but does not impact or change the point cloud because it is inherently 3D data. Since we are using our own custom ground source, we can actually pan and observe a cross-section of the point cloud sitting on, above, or below the ground source and then observe local deviations between the point cloud and the derived DEM surface.\nThe white background might make it difficult to observe the differences. You can change the background color of the scene by left-clicking on “Scene” in the Contents Pane, open the “Properties”, and then select the background color. We suggest using a light grey. There are other options for illumination that you can also modify in the “Properties”, if you want. The image below shows an example of what the IDW might look like:\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore all of the DEM surfaces and export some examples that could help you interpret and illustrate your observations in your report."

Name this P_FC_1989_CedarLeading.gpkg.\nStep 7 Calculate the area and volume of cedar dominant stands in 1989.\n\nClick on the vector icon in the top menu and go to Analysis Tools -&gt; Basic Statistics for Fields\nIn the pop-up window select your P_FC_1989_CedarLeading shapefile. In the field to calculate statistics on click the downward arrow and select “Shape_Area.” Since this is a simple calculation, we will run this as a “temporary output.” Therefore, click Run on the bottom right.\n\nC. In the window that appears, find the count, mean, and sum values. Use these to answer ?sec-Q7 and question 8.\n\n\nStep 9 Calculate the merchantable volume in the 1989 cedar dominant stands.\n\nRight click on the P_FC_1989_Cedarleading layer. Find the Field Calculator  tool.\nIn the pop-up window make sure Create a new field is checked. Input a formula to calculate shape area on. To calculate volume for the polygon, we need to use a measure of volume for the area. We have VOL7_5 which is the volume of trees per hectare that are &gt; 7.5 cm. We also have Shape_Area which is the area of the shape in m². We can use the following formula to calculate the volume per polygon\n\\[Total~Volume (m³) = Polygon~Area (XX) * Volume (m³/ha) \\tag{2.1}\\]\nDo a unit calculation to set up the equation. Shape_area is in m² and VOL7_5 is in m³/ha. If we want output to be in m³ what value do we need for XX ?\nName the field “m3_volume.” Change the Output field type to “Decimal number (real)” and click ok. Estimates for volume for each polygon will now appear. Use these outputs to answer ?sec-Q9.\nUse the Calculate basic statistics tool to calculate the average and total merchantable volumes in the cedar leading polygons.\n\nStep 8 Make a map of the polygons dominated by western redcedar. Look back towards @tip-mapmaking to remind yourself of the process and the essential components to include in your map.\n\nQuestion 5:\n\nHow many western redcedar (&gt;= 50%) polygons were there in 1989?\nWhere are they located?\nWhat polygons are not selected with the filter applied to the data?\n\n\n\nQuestion 6:\nWhat is the FULL latin name for western redcedar (including the namer - a reference to the person that named the species)?\n\n\nQuestion 7:\nWhat is the average polygon size (ha) for the western redcedar dominated stands in 1989? NOTE: 10,000 m2=1 ha (i.e., 1 ha is 100m X 100 m = 10,000 m2)\n\n\nQuestion 8:\nWhat is the total area in ha of all these selected polygons combined?\n\n\nQuestion 9:\nWhat is the value of XX in Equation 2.1 above? Using this equation, hat is the merchantable m3 volume (i.e., merchantable volume for trees 7.50 DBH or larger) for all these selected polygons combined? Do you feel like this a lot?

    "section": "Lab Overview",
    "text": "Lab Overview\nBritish Columbia relies heavily on surveying from aerial imagery to understand forest health. Aerial surveys have been used throughout BC’s recent history to understand forest composition and health. Aerial imagery is the key input into the vegetation resource inventory (or VRI) used to understand the composition of BCs forests. The process has two phases:\n\nPhase 1: Using aerial imagery, forests are divided into homogeneous areas called “polygons.”\nPhase 2: Ground-reference plots are placed systematically throughout polygons. Ground-reference plots are used to determine the site-type or biogeoclimatic zone and subzone of each area. You can find more information on this process here.\n\nThese data are collectively used to obtain information on the forests of BC. However, since forests change over time, VRI also includes regular updates of original VRI data to reflect changes in forest composition associated with:\n\nLarge-scale natural disturbances: e.g., fires, insects, windthrow, etc.\nHuman disturbances: e.g., clear-cuts, partial harvests, roads, new urban areas, etc.\n\nThese new openings result in changes to polygon boundaries and attributes relative to prior dates for the same land area.  In addition, the attributes of each forested polygon are forecasted for stand-level growth to the current date (labelled as “Projected”).  For example, if the stand age was 50 years in 2000, the updated age (called “Projected Age”) in 2015 is 50+15=65 years. There are some attributes such as species composition that cannot be accurately updated via a forecast.  At some point, a re-inventory is needed. Typically, the Province does not regularly update the VRI layers for disturbances on private lands. The VRI for MKRF was actually updated to an entirely new reference year in 2020. We’ve included this data with the course and will introduce it at the end of lab. You can see that the 2014 VRI is largely the same as the 1996 VRI, but when the VRI was updated to a new reference year there were many changes."

    "text": "Task 1: Discover the difference between “Forest Cover” and VRI\nLast week, we used forest cover polygons to look at the forest cover from 1989 and briefly compared changes between 1989 and 1999. These forest cover polygons were created using interpretation of aerial imagery. Both VRI and forest cover polygons intrept components of forests using aerial imagery. However, their standards for photo-interpretation are different.\nIn our dataset, the forest cover polygons are based on photointepretation of 1987 photos, while the 2014 VRI is based on a 19996 aerial survey. Forest cover polygons are updated for natural and human disturbances, whereas VRI polygons are updated for the same disturbances. VRI polygons are also projected to the updated year. Additionally, VRI includes information on four different forest structure layers, from top canopy to the shrub layer. In this lab, we will work with the top of canopy layer. You can find out more on what attributes are recorded in the VRI data dictionary.\n\nBuilding Familiarity with VRI data\nStep 1: Open QGIS and save a new map project. Set up this project similarly to how we did in Task 1 lab 1 (INCLUDE REFERENCE HERE).\nStep 2: Add the following layers to your blank map:\n\nP_Boundary_MRKF\nP_BC_VRI_2014\nP_ForestCover_1989\n\nStep 3: Select “P_BC_VRI_2014” and change the layer symbology. Change the outline to “white” ⬜change the fill color to “light grey” and increase the outline stroke width 0.2 mm. Click Apply and Ok.\nStep 4: Select the “P_ForestCover_1989” and change the symbology. Change the outline color to “orange🟧”\nStep 5: Compare the VRI polygons to the 2006 Orthomosaic. Are there areas where the VRI projection does not make sense? To answer this, set the fill color for the VRI to semi-translucent and zoom to: 1250396, 481902 (*make sure your map CRS is set to BC Conus Albers; EPSG 3005). You can paste these values into the coordinate box on the bottom of the screen.\n\nStep 6: Load in P_ForestCover_2008. This is the updated forest cover layer as of 2006. Find the name of the forest disturbance that occurred in 2006 at the location identified in step 5\n\n\n3.0.1 Question 1:\nWhich description of forest composition and structure (VRI and forest cover) has more polygons?\n\n\n3.0.2 Question 2:\nWhich descriptor of forest composition has a larger average polygon? Which one has a larger maximum polygon?\n\n\n3.0.3 Question 3:\nWhat is the projected age for the polygon at this site? Does this make sense? Why or why not? Insert a screenshot (include a figure caption!) to support your answer.\n\n\n3.0.4 Question 4:\nLook for two other forest disturbances or land-cover changes anywhere in MKRF recorded in the 2006 orthomosaic but not recorded in the 2014 VRI.\n\n\n3.0.5 Question 5:\nMalcom Knapp is privately owned land, meaning not all disturbances are consistently added to VRI. Given this, what are some of the disadvantages of relying on VRI alone? What additional tools can we use to better update VRI? Respond in a clear and well written paragraph format."

Note that the linked version is version 5 - reflecting that these standards are fifth version of VRI photo-interpretation standards since 1999 (when the VRI program was established). Focus on Figure 2.1 and Figure 2.2. These show initial steps in segmenting the land base into forest cover polygons. You will be interpreting a 2006 photo of area of MKRF using these two figures and “heads-up digitizing.” Normally, this first step would be done using a 3-D view of overlapping aerial images. You will be using a 2-D view for this first step in photo-interpretation to get an idea of how this is initially done. These larger polygons would be further stratified using forest cover attributes, and all attributes added as documented in the VRI photo-interpretation standards.\nStep 1 Add the 2008 and the 2006 aerial imagery to your map.

    "text": "Task 3: Understand Variability in Pixel Data\nWe have established an understanding of the key characteristics of different land cover types and how these relate to brightness values. We will now use QGIS to create a new polygon feature that will help better understand variability in pixel data, and how this variability can help us explore our datasets.\nStep 1 Create a new shapefile layer by going to Layer -&gt; Create a Layer -&gt; Create a new shapefile layer\n\nStep 2 Save your shapefile to the same location as your exercise two, name this layer “Landcover Types.shp”. For the Geometry Type select “polygon.” In the New Field window create a Text field called “class.” Make sure to click Add to Fields List. Click Ok. Your new layer should appear in the layers panel.\nStep 3 Right click on your new layer in the layers panel. Select Toggle Editing. The layer can now be actively edited.\nStep 4 Click on the polygon tool  in the upper left of the screen. This tool allows you to add new polygons to your shapefile. To add a polygon, left-click to begin a shape and add addition vertices. To finish a shape right-click. Use this process to add polygons that cover (a) a fresh clearcut (b) a lake (c) an older clearcut (d) a mixed forest (e) coniferous forest in the 2006 RGB image. When you finish a polygon make sure to note the landcover type in your “class” field.\n\nStep 5 once you have finished right-click on your layer in the Layers panel to save the layer edits. Additionally, change the symbology of this layer to show the individual layer attributes. See an example in Figure 3.1.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Landcover types for polygon based on interpretation of 2006 aerial RGB imagery. Note that 2008 is shown in background\n\n\nStep 5 We will now introduce the processing toolbox. This is a great resource for finding tools that help analyze spatial data. The processing toolbox is normally located on the upper right-hand of of the QGIS window. If it is not there, you can load it by going to View -&gt; Panels -&gt; Processing Toolbox.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 6 In the search bar located at the top of the processing toolbox type in “Zonal” and select Zonal statistics. In the pop-up window make the following selections\n\nInput layer: Select your class polygons\nRaster layer: Select the 2006 RGB image\nRaster band: Select the green band\nOutput column prefix: type “Brt” (for pixel brightness values)\nRight click on the “…” in statistics to calculate. In the new menu select (1) Mean (2) St Dec (2) Minimum and (3) maximum\nSave the file to the same location as your exercise 2\n\n\nStep 7 Using the new shapefile, color the shapefile by mean brightness. Under symbology select “graduated” and for the color palette choose “greys.” At the top to the color palette window choose invert color ramp. Inverting the color ramp means that the polygons where the mean brightness values is low will be closer to black and polygons where the mean brightness is high will be closer to white.\nStep 8 We will now create a new map layout to showcase some the forest cover polygons we have created. Go to file New print layout andcreate a new map layout named “forest cover polygons.” Make the orientation of new map horizontal. Our new map layout will have three different maps. The first, will describe the forest cover polygons we have created. The second, will describe in the mean brightness for the RGB data we have. Finally, we will have a third map that will look at the variability in these brightness responses.\nStep 9 We’ll start with the map the describes our forest polygons.\n\nchange the symbology of the forest polygons shapefile to give each polygon a unique color. Go to symbology -&gt; categorized -&gt; select your “class” field -&gt; and classify. Click Apply but NOT ok.\nOn the left-hand of this pop-up window go to “labels” and select Single Label for Value select your “class” field.\nClick on Buffer and check the box that says Draw text Buffer this will put a small white buffer around our labels\nClick on Placement change the mode to Offset from centroid. Click the box that says Allow placing of labels outside of polygons. Change the Quadrant to the upper-left\nClick Apply - labels should now appear on the map canvas\nClick Ok.\n\n\n\nNavigate back to your map layout. Insert a new map for your forest polygons. In the background, include the BC VRI and 2008 RGB image. The screenshot below highlights what should be included. Set the map scale to 70000 to best include all of MKRF.\n\n\n\nIn the right-hand side under Layers click the checkmark that says Lock layers and Lock styles for Layers this prevents your map from automatically updating.\nAdd a legend. In Legend items uncheck “auto update” and remove all legend items are are not your forest cover polygons. On the forest polygon layer right-click to check “hidden.” In the Title for the legend put “Forest Polygon Class”\nRight click on the map on your map layout to copy and paste the map so there is a duplicate map next to your forest polygon map. With this map selected uncheck the Lock layers and Lock styles for Layers. Navigate back to your map canvas\n\nStep 9 We’ll now map the average green brightness value in these polygons.\n\nUsing your layer that we calculated zonal statistics on, which should still be colored black-to-white. Move this layer to the top of the map canvas.\nNavigate back to your map layout. With the copied map selected change the name to “zonal mean.” In the item properties tab click the circular “refresh” button. This will update the map to the current canvas layers. Click Lock layers and Lock styles for Layer.\n\nCopy the Legend from your polygons layer. Change the reference map to the zonal statistics layer. In the legend properties check “update all”. Change the Title to “Mean Bit Brightness (Green Band)”.\n\nRight click on the map on your map layout to copy and paste the map so there is a duplicate map next to your forest zonal statistics map. With this map selected uncheck the Lock layers and Lock styles for Layers. Navigate back to your map canvas.\n\nStep 10 Follow a similar process to step 9, but this time change the zonal statistics layer to the standard deviation. See Figure 3.2 for an example of your final output.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Example output for forest cover map. **Note your map will be different according to where you place your polygons\n\n\n\nQuestion 9:\nHow do values for your different forest polygons layer differ in terms of brightness? What feature had the highest greenness reflectance? Which feature had the most variable greenness reflectance? Use values to support your results.\n\n\nQuestion 10:\nNormally, photo-interpreters would have a 3-D view of a stereo-pair of photos and they could see and measure stand heights.
