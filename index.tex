Foresters use maps to visualize site composition, leading tree species,
and volume across a landbase. In this lab, we introduce the datasets
enable forestry professionals to create these maps. The focus of the lab
is not on the GIS approach, but rather becoming familiar enough with the
data structure you feel empowered to create your own maps for a
landbase. We will also do some simple calculations within QGIS to better
understand the data structure and possible applications. This lab uses
forest inventory data from Malcom Knapp Research Forest (MKRF)

Background \{.unnumbered\}

Malcom Knapp Research Forest is a UBC affiliated research forest that is
located near Maple Ridge, BC. The forest was established in 1949 and is
managed by staff to be \emph{commercially viable} and \emph{financially
independent} of UBC. The forest is \textasciitilde5,000 ha and covers a
large mountainous area. Most of the forest is located in the Coastal
Western Hemlock (CWH) biogeoclimatic (BEC) zone. As a result, some of
the trees are very large (\textgreater{} 2 m than diameter and over 65
m).

\section*{Task 1: Set Up QGIS}\label{task-1-set-up-qgis}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Task 1: Set Up QGIS}

\markright{Task 1: Set Up QGIS}

\textbf{Step 1:} Open QGIS on your laptop. Choose `blank project.' Save
the project with a file name that you can remember and location you can
remember. Ex: Exercise1\_Map.qgz

When you first open QGIS you will notice a main map canvas. To the left
of this map canvas are two windows \textbf{Browser} and \textbf{Layers}.
The \textbf{Layers} panel is the best way to understand the order of
data on the main map canvas and is the best way to change the data
presentation (symbology) and access the data in tabular format. On the
top the QGIS menu are a series of additional buttons which we will
introduce throughout this lab and course. Finally, on the bottom are the
details of the map canvas including the current center or selected
coordinate, the map scale, rotation, and the coordinate reference system
(CRS)

\textbf{Step 2:} Set the project CRS. In BC, the provincial standard CRS
is NAD83/BC Albers map projection (EPSG:3005). To set the projects CRS
navigate to the bottom left of the window and click on the
\textbf{EPSG:4326 as shown below:}

Search for EPSG:3005 and \textbf{click apply} and \textbf{Ok}.

\textbf{Step 3:} Set up a `favorites' folder to easily access the MKRF
data. Right click on `Favorites' and click \textbf{add a directory}.
Navigate to the storage location for you MKRF data. Click \textbf{ok}

\hypertarget{building-familiarity}{%
\subsubsection*{Building Familiarity}\label{building-familiarity}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Building Familiarity}

\textbf{Step 4:} Add \textbf{P\_Boundary\_MKRF.gpkg} to the map. From
the \textbf{browser} window select the file and \textbf{drag and drop}
into the main map. This will add the boundary MRKF as a polygon feature.
This layer is shown in the main map and listed in `layers' on the
left-hand `layers' panel.

\textbf{Step 5:} Change the symbology of the boundary file by right
clicking on \textbf{P\_Boundary\_MKRF.gpkg} in the layers pane. Select
\textbf{Properties}. A window will pop-up. On the left-hand side the
layer properties including: General, Source, Symbology, Labels, Fields,
Joins, Diagrams. Select \textbf{Symbology} (The icon with the
paintbrush). Keep the format as `single symbol.' Change the layer to
have a black outline with no fill by clicking on the icon `simple fill.'
Change the fill color to `transparent' and the stroke width to `0.2'

\textbf{Step 6:} Add \textbf{L\_streams\_major.gkpg}. In the `layers'
panel this will be the first, reflecting that this layer is above the
boundary file. Change the color to something that represents streams
(like.. blue?)

\textbf{Step 7:} Navigate the around the map project by selecting the
\includegraphics{images/clipboard-2808075886.png} icon. You can use the
\includegraphics[width=0.95833in,height=\textheight]{images/clipboard-1487886273.png}
to zoom and out.

\textbf{Step 8:} Add the \textbf{P\_lakes.gpgk}. Right-click on this
layer in the layers panel and select \textbf{Attribute Table}. This
gives details about the polygon features of the dataset. The shape area
for each has been calculated in the `Shape\_Area' field.

\hypertarget{question-1}{%

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Task 2: Making a Site Index Map}

\markright{Task 2: Making a Site Index Map}

\ul{Site index is a measure of productivity}. It is technically defined
as: \ul{\emph{expected height (m) of the best trees (not damaged,
biggest) of the dominant species at a reference age of 50 years breast
height age}}. The site index reflects the potential of the site to grow
this dominant species. Although this might also indicate how another
species might do, this does not give a measure of the possible
productivity of another species. For example, a site that is douglas-fir
leading and has a high site index would not indicate that a species like
whitebark pine (a high alpine species) would also do well. Also, if the
soils change (e.g., landslides, fertilization, etc.) or the
climate/hydrology changes, the site index might not be a good an
indicator of the productivity for the historically dominant species.
Importantly, for site index to be reported there have to be trees in the
stand. In the MKRF dataset some recently harvested stands may show a
``0'' for site index, but this is really an NA.

\textbf{Step 1} Load \textbf{P\_ForestCover\_1989.gpkg}. Right click on
the layer in the \textbf{layers} window and select \textbf{Open
Attribute Table}. this will open an attribute table that describes the
polygon components. Click on the the heading for \textbf{SITEINDX} to
sort the table from smallest to largest site index. Many polygons have
``0.0 m'' for a site index value. Scroll right to the ``non-forest
descriptor'' or \textbf{NFD} columbn. Here notes like ``NSR'' note sites
that are ``not-satisfactorily restocked, or there may be lakes. These
are examples of polygons where there are no trees and thus no site-index
value.

\textbf{Step 2} Click to the \textbf{SITEINDX} column heading again to
sort from largest to smallest. See \textbf{?@sec-Q3} to answer. Close
the attribute table.

\textbf{Step 3} Right click on the \textbf{P\_ForestCover\_1989} layer
again in the \textbf{layers} panel and select \textbf{Properties}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Select \textbf{Symbology} and change the symbol from ``single Symbol''
  to ``Graduated''
\item
  Under \textbf{Value} click the small down arrow on the right to select
  the ``SITEINDX'' column.
\item
  In the \textbf{Color ramp} field click the small down arrow on the
  right to select the ``Viridis'' color palette
\item
  At the bottom of the symbology window, select \textbf{Classify}. This
  will classify the values in ``SITEINDX'' based on their values into
  different colors associated with the viridis color ramp.
\item
  Under \textbf{Classify} and \textbf{Mode} select ``Equal Interval''
  and change the number of \textbf{classes} to ``12''. Click
  \textbf{Classify} again.
\item
  In the \textbf{Classes} pain (the main white box) change these to
  \textbf{5 m classes} as 0.00 to 0.00 (i.e., no site index), 0.05 to
  5.05, 5.05 to 10.05, 10.05 to 15.05, etc.
\item
  Click \textbf{Apply and OK}. The symbology window will close and you
  can now see your recolored layer

  represents 0.5 km (50,000 cm)
\item
  Use \includegraphics{images/clipboard-559090363.png} on the left-hand
  side to add a \textbf{Legend} (the + sign appears in the cursor, drag

\item
  Use \includegraphics{images/clipboard-1747724821.png} to add a
  \textbf{Scale Bar.} Click on the \textbf{Item Properties} box. Change
  the ``Division Units'' to kilometres and then select a scale graphic
  you like.
\item
  Use \includegraphics{images/clipboard-769114577.png} to add a
  \textbf{Title}.
\item
  Add a north arrow by clicking
  \includegraphics{images/clipboard-1756855161.png} and drag the curse
  to the map area.
\item
  Right click on each item on your map and select \textbf{Item
  Properties} to make any other changes to improve the appearance of
  your map. Alternatively, on the right-hand side there is \textbf{Item
  properties} icon where you can change the style of the items you added
  to the map (i.e., north arrow, legend, your map). NOTE: One could
  spend many hours on this! Just do some improvements.

1989}

\textbf{Step 1} Close the \textbf{Layout} window and go back to the
\textbf{Data view} window again.

\textbf{Step 2} Change the \textbf{fc\_1989}-layer properties to a
\textbf{Single Symbol} again.

\textbf{Step 3} Right click on the \textbf{fc\_1989} layer and choose
\textbf{Open Attribute Table}. Each line of this table shows the
attributes for one polygon (including \textbf{SITEINDX} that you already
used). You can see the total number of polygons at the top of the
\textbf{Attribute Table} (1149 polygons). Keep this attribute table open
in this new window.

\textbf{Step 4} Select polygons where the first species is western
redcedar and the cedar is more than 50\% of the species composition. To
do so you will use a ``Query.'' To select \ul{polygons where the first
species is western redcedar and more than 50\% of the species
composition,} you will need to do a Query.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\item
  In the \textbf{Attribute Table} select
  \includegraphics{images/clipboard-3366763250.png} to open up the
  \textbf{Query Fields}
\item
  Scroll down a bit to find ``SPSC1'' and ``PCT1'', select for
  \textbf{SPSC1}=C and \textbf{PCT1}\textgreater=50. Click
  \textbf{Select Features}

  \includegraphics[width=3.75in,height=\textheight]{images/clipboard-1889425914.png}
\item
  Click the \includegraphics{images/clipboard-633541715.png} to return
  to the tabular format. You can see that we have now selected have a
  SPCS1 (leading species) of ``C'' for cedar, and that these polygons
  are \textgreater= 50\%. Use this to answer \textbf{question 5}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Step 6} Export your selection under it's own shapefile. You can
minimize or close the attribute table. In the \textbf{layers} panel
right click and select \textbf{Export -\textgreater{} Save Selected
Features As} save this as a gpkg file in the same folder as your MRKF
data. Name this \textbf{P\_FC\_1989\_CedarLeading.gpkg}.

\textbf{Step 7} Calculate the area and volume of cedar dominant stands
in 1989.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Click on the \textbf{vector} icon in the top menu and go to
  \textbf{Analysis Tools -\textgreater{} Basic Statistics for Fields}
\item
  In the pop-up window select your P\_FC\_1989\_CedarLeading shapefile.
  In the \textbf{field to calculate statistics on} click the downward
  arrow and select ``Shape\_Area.'' Since this is a simple calculation,
  we will run this as a ``temporary output.'' Therefore, click
  \textbf{Run} on the bottom right.
\end{enumerate}

C. In the window that appears, find the \textbf{count, mean, and sum
values}. Use these to answer \textbf{?@sec-Q7} and question 8.

\includegraphics[width=3.5625in,height=\textheight]{images/clipboard-30022994.png}

\textbf{Step 9} Calculate the merchantable volume in the 1989 cedar
dominant stands.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Right click on the P\_FC\_1989\_Cedarleading layer. Find the
  \textbf{Field Calculator}
  \includegraphics{images/clipboard-1506137763.png} tool.
\item
  In the pop-up window make sure \textbf{Create a new field} is checked.
  Input a formula to calculate shape area on. To calculate volume for
  the polygon, we need to use a measure of volume for the area. We have
  \textbf{VOL7\_5} which is the volume of trees per hectare that are
  \textgreater{} 7.5 cm. We also have \textbf{Shape\_Area} which is the
  area of the shape in m². We can use the following formula to calculate
  the volume per polygon

  \begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-volume}{}{Total~Volume (m³) = Polygon~Area (XX) * Volume (m³/ha)}\label{eq-volume}\end{equation}
\item
  Do a unit calculation to set up the equation. Shape\_area is in m² and
  VOL7\_5 is in m³/ha. If we want output to be in m³ what value do we
  need for XX ?
\item
  Name the field ``m3\_volume.'' Change the \textbf{Output field type}
  to ``Decimal number (real)'' and click \textbf{ok.} Estimates for
  volume for each polygon will now appear. Use these outputs to answer
  \textbf{?@sec-Q9}.
\item
  Use the \textbf{Calculate basic statistics tool} to calculate the
  average and total merchantable volumes in the cedar leading polygons.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Step 8} Make a map of the polygons dominated by western
redcedar. Look back towards @tip-mapmaking to remind yourself of the
process and the essential components to include in your map.

\markright{Lab Overview}

British Columbia relies heavily on surveying from aerial imagery to
understand forest health. Aerial surveys have been used throughout BC's
recent history to understand forest composition and health. Aerial
imagery is the key input into the vegetation resource inventory (or VRI)
used to understand the composition of BCs forests. The process has two
phases:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Phase 1: Using aerial imagery, forests are divided into homogeneous
  areas called ``polygons.''
\item
  Phase 2: Ground-reference plots are placed systematically throughout
  polygons. Ground-reference plots are used to determine the site-type
  or biogeoclimatic zone and subzone of each area. You can find more
  information on this process
  \href{https://cfcg.forestry.ubc.ca/resources/cataloguing-in-situ-genetic-resources/about-bec-and-bgc-units/}{here}.
\end{itemize}

These data are collectively used to obtain information on the forests of
BC.~However, since forests change over time, VRI also includes
\ul{regular updates} of original VRI data to reflect changes in forest
composition associated with:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \ul{Large-scale} \ul{natural disturbances}:~e.g., fires, insects,
  windthrow, etc.
\item
  \ul{Human disturbances}:~e.g., clear-cuts, partial harvests, roads,
  new urban areas, etc.
\end{itemize}

These new openings result in \ul{changes to polygon boundaries and
attributes relative to prior dates for the same land area}.~ In
addition, \ul{the attributes of each forested polygon are forecasted for
stand-level growth to the current date (labelled as ``Projected'')}.~
For example, if the stand age was 50 years in 2000, the updated age
(called ``Projected Age'') in 2015 is 50+15=65 years. There are some
attributes such as species composition that cannot be accurately updated
via a forecast.~ \ul{At some point, a re-inventory is needed}.
Typically, the Province does not regularly update the VRI layers for
disturbances on private lands. The VRI for MKRF was actually updated to
an entirely new reference year in 2020. We've included this data with
the course and will introduce it at the end of lab. You can see that the
2014 VRI is largely the same as the 1996 VRI, but when the VRI was
updated to a new reference year there were many changes.

\markright{Task 1: Discover the difference between ``Forest Cover'' and
VRI}

Last week, we used forest cover polygons to look at the forest cover
from 1989 and briefly compared changes between 1989 and 1999. These
forest cover polygons were created using interpretation of aerial
imagery. Both VRI and forest cover polygons intrept components of
forests using aerial imagery. However, their standards for
photo-interpretation are different.

In our dataset, the forest cover polygons are based on
photointepretation of 1987 photos, while the 2014 VRI is based on a
19996 aerial survey. Forest cover polygons are updated for natural and
human disturbances, whereas VRI polygons are updated for the same
disturbances. VRI polygons are also projected to the updated year.
Additionally, VRI includes information on four different forest
structure layers, from top canopy to the shrub layer. In this lab, we
will work with the top of canopy layer. You can find out more on what
attributes are recorded in
\href{https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/farming-natural-resources-and-industry/forestry/stewardship/forest-analysis-inventory/data-management/standards/vegcomp_poly_rank1_data_dictionaryv5_2019.pdf}{the

\textbf{Step 1:} Open QGIS and save a new map project. Set up this
project similarly to how we did in Task 1 lab 1 (INCLUDE REFERENCE
HERE).

\textbf{Step 2:} Add the following layers to your blank map:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  P\_Boundary\_MRKF
\item
  P\_BC\_VRI\_2014
\item
  P\_ForestCover\_1989
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Step 3:} Select ``P\_BC\_VRI\_2014'' and change the layer
symbology. Change the outline to ``white'' ⬜change the fill color to
``light grey'' and increase the outline stroke width 0.2 mm. Click
\textbf{Apply and Ok.}

\textbf{Step 4:} Select the ``P\_ForestCover\_1989'' and change the
symbology. Change the outline color to ``orange🟧''

\textbf{Step 5:} Compare the VRI polygons to the 2006 Orthomosaic. Are
there areas where the VRI projection does not make sense? To answer
this, set the fill color for the VRI to semi-translucent and zoom to:
1250396, 481902 (*\emph{make sure your map CRS is set to BC Conus
Albers; EPSG 3005)}. You can paste these values into the coordinate box
on the bottom of the screen.

\includegraphics[width=2.39583in,height=0.26042in]{images/clipboard-2547981647.png}

\textbf{Step 6:} Load in P\_ForestCover\_2008. This is the updated
forest cover layer as of 2006. Find the name of the forest disturbance

standards} provided by the Ministry. Note that the linked version is
version 5 - reflecting that these standards are fifth version of VRI
photo-interpretation standards since 1999 (when the VRI program was
established). Focus on \textbf{Figure 2.1 and Figure 2.2}. These show
initial steps in segmenting the land base into forest cover polygons.
You will be interpreting a 2006 photo of area of MKRF using these two
figures and ``heads-up digitizing.'' Normally, this first step would be
done using a 3-D view of overlapping aerial images. You will be using a
2-D view for this first step in photo-interpretation to get an idea of
how this is initially done. These larger polygons would be further
stratified using forest cover attributes, and all attributes added as
documented in the VRI photo-interpretation standards.

\textbf{Step 1} Add the 2008 and the 2006 aerial imagery to your map.
Note that the 2008 photo is only part of the MRKF

\textbf{Step 2} zoom into the three following locations below. Create a

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Task 3: Understand Variability in Pixel
Data}

\markright{Task 3: Understand Variability in Pixel Data}

We have established an understanding of the key characteristics of
different land cover types and how these relate to brightness values. We
will now use QGIS to create a new polygon feature that will help better
understand variability in pixel data, and how this variability can help
us explore our datasets.

\textbf{Step 1} Create a new shapefile layer by going to \textbf{Layer
-\textgreater{} Create a Layer -\textgreater{} Create a new shapefile
layer}

\includegraphics{images/clipboard-477174409.png}

\textbf{Step 2} Save your shapefile to the same location as your
exercise two, name this layer ``Landcover Types.shp''. For the
\textbf{Geometry Type} select ``polygon.'' In the \textbf{New Field}
window create a \textbf{Text} field called ``class.'' Make sure to click
\textbf{Add to Fields List.} Click \textbf{Ok.} Your new layer should
appear in the layers panel.

\textbf{Step 3} Right click on your new layer in the \textbf{layers
panel.} Select \textbf{Toggle Editing.} The layer can now be actively
edited.

\textbf{Step 4} Click on the polygon tool
\includegraphics{images/clipboard-3885190170.png} in the upper left of
the screen. This tool allows you to add new polygons to your shapefile.
To add a polygon, left-click to begin a shape and add addition vertices.
To finish a shape \textbf{right-click.} Use this process to add polygons
that cover (a) a fresh clearcut (b) a lake (c) an older clearcut (d) a
mixed forest (e) coniferous forest in the \ul{\textbf{2006}} \textbf{RGB
image}. When you finish a polygon make sure to note the landcover type
in your ``class'' field.

\includegraphics[width=2.46875in,height=\textheight]{images/clipboard-1460819033.png}

\textbf{Step 5} once you have finished right-click on your layer in the
\textbf{Layers} panel to save the layer edits. Additionally, change the
\textbf{symbology} of this layer to show the individual layer
attributes. See an example in Figure~\ref{fig-1}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=5.75in,height=\textheight]{images/clipboard-1582844239.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-1}Landcover types for polygon based on
interpretation of 2006 aerial RGB imagery. \emph{Note that 2008 is shown
in background}}

\end{figure}

\textbf{Step 5} We will now introduce the \textbf{processing toolbox}.
This is a great resource for finding tools that help analyze spatial
data. The processing toolbox is normally located on the upper right-hand
of of the QGIS window. If it is not there, you can load it by going to
\textbf{View -\textgreater{} Panels -\textgreater{} Processing Toolbox.}

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=4.89583in,height=\textheight]{images/clipboard-3381024759.png} \hfill{}

\end{figure}

\textbf{Step 6} In the search bar located at the top of the
\textbf{processing toolbox} type in ``Zonal'' and select \textbf{Zonal
statistics.} In the pop-up window make the following selections

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Input layer:} Select your class polygons
\item
  \textbf{Raster layer}: Select the \textbf{2006 RGB} image
\item
  \textbf{Raster band:} Select the green band
\item
  \textbf{Output column prefix:} type ``\emph{Brt'' (for pixel
  brightness values})
\item
  \textbf{Right click on the ``\ldots{}'' in statistics to calculate.}
  In the new menu select (1) Mean (2) St Dec (2) Minimum and (3) maximum
\item
  \textbf{Save the file to the same location as your exercise 2}
\end{enumerate}

\includegraphics[width=4.17708in,height=\textheight]{images/clipboard-1244300705.png}

\textbf{Step 7} Using the new shapefile, color the shapefile by mean
brightness. Under \textbf{symbology} select ``graduated'' and for the
color palette choose ``greys.'' At the top to the color palette window
choose \textbf{invert color ramp}. Inverting the color ramp means that
the polygons where the mean brightness values is low will be closer to
black and polygons where the mean brightness is high will be closer to
white.

\textbf{Step 8} We will now create a new map layout to showcase some the
forest cover polygons we have created. Go to file \textbf{New print
layout} andcreate a new map layout named ``forest cover polygons.'' Make
the orientation of new map \textbf{horizontal.} Our new map layout will
have three different maps. The first, will describe the forest cover
polygons we have created. The second, will describe in the mean
brightness for the RGB data we have. Finally, we will have a third map
that will look at the variability in these brightness responses.

\textbf{Step 9} We'll start with the map the describes our forest
polygons.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  change the symbology of the forest polygons shapefile to give each
  polygon a unique color. Go to symbology -\textgreater{} categorized
  -\textgreater{} select your ``class'' field -\textgreater{} and
  classify. Click \textbf{Apply} but NOT \textbf{ok.}
\item
  On the left-hand of this pop-up window go to ``labels'' and select
  \textbf{Single Label} for \textbf{Value} select your ``class'' field.
\item
  Click on \textbf{Buffer} and check the box that says \textbf{Draw text
  Buffer} this will put a small white buffer around our labels
\item
  Click on \textbf{Placement} change the \textbf{mode} to \textbf{Offset
  from centroid}. Click the box that says \textbf{Allow placing of
  labels outside of polygons.} Change the \textbf{Quadrant} to the
  upper-left
\item
  Click \textbf{Apply} - labels should now appear on the map canvas
\item
  Click \textbf{Ok.}
\end{enumerate}

\includegraphics{images/clipboard-74741472.png}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{6}
\tightlist
\item
  Navigate back to your map layout. Insert a new map for your forest
  polygons. In the background, include the BC VRI and 2008 RGB image.
  The screenshot below highlights what should be included. Set the map
  scale to 70000 to best include all of MKRF.
\end{enumerate}

\includegraphics[width=3.60417in,height=\textheight]{images/clipboard-1857806976.png}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{7}
\item
  In the right-hand side under \textbf{Layers} click the checkmark that
  says \textbf{Lock layers and Lock styles for Layers} this prevents
  your map from automatically updating.
\item
  Add a legend\textbf{.} In \textbf{Legend items} uncheck ``auto
  update'' and remove all legend items are are not your forest cover
  polygons. On the forest polygon layer right-click to check ``hidden.''
  In the \textbf{Title} for the legend put ``Forest Polygon Class''
\item
  Right click on the map on your map layout to \textbf{copy and paste}
  the map so there is a duplicate map next to your forest polygon map.
  With this map selected \textbf{uncheck} the \textbf{Lock layers and
  Lock styles for Layers}. Navigate back to your map canvas
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Step 9} We'll now map the average green brightness value in
these polygons.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Using your layer that we calculated zonal statistics on, which should
  still be colored black-to-white. Move this layer to the top of the map
  canvas.
\item
  Navigate back to your map layout. With the copied map selected change
  the name to ``zonal mean.'' In the item properties tab click the
  circular ``refresh'' button. This will update the map to the current
  canvas layers. Click \textbf{Lock layers and Lock styles for Layer.}\\
  \includegraphics{images/clipboard-1003007197.png}
\item
  Copy the Legend from your polygons layer. Change the reference map to
  the zonal statistics layer. In the legend properties check ``update
  all''. Change the \textbf{Title} to ``Mean Bit Brightness (Green
  Band)''.\\
  \includegraphics{images/clipboard-798660786.png}
\item
  Right click on the map on your map layout to \textbf{copy and paste}
  the map so there is a duplicate map next to your forest zonal
  statistics map. With this map selected \textbf{uncheck} the
  \textbf{Lock layers and Lock styles for Layers}. Navigate back to your
  map canvas.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Step 10} Follow a similar process to step 9, but this time
change the zonal statistics layer to the standard deviation. See
Figure~\ref{fig-2} for an example of your final output.

Aerial Photographs}

\markright{Task 4: Satellite Images Compared to Aerial Photographs}

Images collected using satellites provide the base data used to create
Google Maps, Google Earth Views, etc. Of these, data collected on
Landsat satellites is very commonly used. However, other imagery is
often needed to provide finer spatial details, historic views, and 3-D
views. You will learn more about other imagery in FRST 538. For now, you
will look at the Landsat imagery provided for MKRF and compare these to
the aerial photographs. Specifically, you will look at how these images
might be used to update for natural and human disturbances.

\textbf{Step 1} Add the 2019 Landsat RGB image, keeping both the 2008
and 2006 orthoimages loaded. Clearly, there are differences in the
spectral reflectance and the resolution of these two images. However,
Landsat is free and is consistently capturing imagery from space every
two-weeks (when it is cloud free).

\textbf{Step 2} qualitatively compare the orthoimages from the satellite
data. Use this to answer the last lab questiosn

dominated stands? Please answer in hectares.

For example, if the answer was 103 m, we would use 40 m by 100 m spacing
(not 105 m and not 103 m spacing), since forest land areas are often
irregular in shape and this would ``pull in'' the systematic sampling
grid to hopefully get enough plots.

What would the spacing be, if this square spacing between plot centres
was used instead? Again, in practice, we would round this answer down to
the nearest 5 m to lay this out in the field.

Which of these two options would you choose to use and why?

This lab builds on our previous work to introduce more stand-level
summaries as well as using forest data to summarize important forest
attributes like volume and biomass. You will work with formulas, created
from test data, to understand a forest-stand. Using your estimates you
will produce a data summary for a landowner. You may work in groups for
this lab, but each student must be able to run the code on their own
computer.

\textbf{General Description}

A landowner hires you to conduct a survey of a 30-ha forested parcel of
land (BC Coast).~In particular, the owner would like to know how much
they could make on the carbon market if they kept this forest intact and
sold the carbon credits.~From reading several documents, you find out
that: 1) about 50\% of aboveground biomass is carbon; and 2) the rate
for carbon credits is about \$65 CAD per C tonne. The owner would also
like to know general information about the timber characteristics for
general management purposes.

For today's data investigation we will use formulas created by the
ministry to calculate volume and dry biomass for different tree species
in British Columbia. The coefficients are described in the table below.
Models for volume use Schumaker's volume function.

\markright{Data Description}

You decide to use a systematic sampling approach to determine plot
centres for \emph{n}=4 plots.~For each plot center, you establish a
circular, fixed-area plot (r=11.27 m; 0.04 ha) aiming to sample all
trees which are ≥ 2.0 cm DBH within this radius. Some plots had a lot of
trees and thus a process of ``Half Sweeps'' was conducted, where a
randomly chosen half of the 0.04 ha (or a slice) was selected and only
trees in that half of the plot were recorded (i.e., each tree counts
twice in the 0.04 ha plot OR the plot size was reduced to 0.02 ha).

For each tree (DBH≥2.0 cm) in the plot (full or half plot), the species
was recorded and the DBH (cm) was measured. On a subset of trees, the
height (m) was measured in the field. For the remaining trees, the
height was estimated in the office using existing height/DBH models
(i.e., for each tree without height, the species-specific models
developed for this area were used to estimate height from DBH). ~{[}For
broken trees,{]} the height to the break was measured in the field, and
an estimate of the height that the tree might have been if not broken
was also recorded in the field. A snapshot of these data are provided
below.

From these data, you determine the characteristics of the forest land
and report these to the landowner, along with your estimate of potential
carbon credits.

\markright{Plot Level Analyses}

Following the example code below (using fake data!) use the \emph{real}
data included in your lab exercises to calculate the average tree size
in terms of DBH, height and basal area per tree, total volume per tree,
and biomass. Remember to report the measurements units for each of these
metrics. The code below includes both a right and a wrong version. In
your analysis, discuss which version you used and why. Additionally,
there were some useful formulas created to analyse data in lab 3. We'll
be working work this code for our analyses.

Use the Kozak (2002) taper model again, but this time to calculate the

height to a 10.0 cm top diameter inside bark. Some parts of the tree
will not be included in this merchantable volume and will have a zero
volume, namely the stump segment, and the parts of the tree above 10.0
cm top diameter inside bark. You will have to modify the section lengths
to obtain a 10.0 cm top diameter inside bark and then sections higher
than this will have a zero volume. What is the merchantable tree volume?
Again, keep four decimals only.

Merchantable Volume worksheet for this; instead, use the worksheet to
get the answers (i.e.~when is the tree too small in width). The
merchantable length and merchantable height will be in m. By convention,
we keep one decimal place for tree heights and for merchantable lengths.

For the same tree large hybrid spruce as in Question 1 of Part I,
calculate the estimated total volume using the BC coefficients based on
Schumacher's model (Schumacher and Hall, 1933), but fitted using BC tree
data, and compare this to volume using Kozak's model.You will need to
use the Key Equations from Excercise 4 to calculate the volume using the
mature douglas fir coefficients. \#\#\# Question 9 \{.unnumbered\}
Compare this to the estimated total volume you calculated using Kozak's
taper model for this large hybrid spruce. NOTES: Since these were both
found using models, they are both estimated volumes. However, on one
hand, the volume models would be expected to be more precise for
estimating tree volume since they estimate this directly whereas the
volume using the taper model are calculated by first calculating the
estimated diameters inside bark up the stem. On the other hand, taper
models can be used for more than just estimated total volume (i.e.,
merchantable volume, log volumes, etc. as you did in Task 1 \& 2).

Then, estimate the aboveground biomass (kg) for a E. regnans that is
120.0 cm DBH (Note: Measured at 1.37 m above ground in Australia) and
51.0 m in height. For this, use Eq. 8 that uses DBH only (labelled as D,
cm) or Eq. 10 that uses D2H,(DBH (cm) squared time height (m)) from the
paper. The parameter estimates for each of these models and that species
are found in Table 2. You will need to calculate the total stem biomass
and the crown biomass first, and add them together to get total tree
(aboveground) biomass, as shown in Eq. 8 or 10, to get aboveground
biomass. :::\{.callout-note\} NOTE: You might want to input these DBH
and height measures into Standish et al.~(1985) biomass model for mature

be for this E. regnans tree using the Bi et al.~(2015) models. :::

For timber supply (and other forest-level analyses), forecasts of each
stand (or aggregates of similar stands) are needed to evaluate different
management scenarios. For these analyses, yield tables for each stand
type and management regime are needed to make these forecasts. In BC,
VDYP is used for ``unmanaged'' stands and TIPSY is used for ``managed''
stands. There are other models (e.g., PrognosisBC) also available for
use by BC forest professionals. :::\{.callout-note collapse=`true'\}

  Competition depends on overlap of crowns
\item
  50 years of research

  \textbf{SORTIEBC}
\item
  Tree-level distance dependent model that is considered a ``hybrid''
  model since competition is based on light interception by crowns

  Forsyte, Forsee, Fortoon: Developed by Kimmins, professor emeritus at
  UBC. A hybrid model. Zelig: GAP model MGM: Developed for mixed species
  stands at the University of Alberta by Titus
\item

  GYPSY (Alberta), etc.)} :::
\end{itemize}

To become familiar with how VDYP and TIPSY can be used to forecast the
growth and yield of stands, you will forecast three polygons from MKRF.
You will use the VRI forest inventory, layer 1 attributes, as inputs to
VDYP. This links the VDYP model to forest inventory information, which
is what happens for ``unmanaged'' stands in timber supply analyses. You
will then simulate harvests of these stands and forecast future growth
and yield post-harvest using TIPSY.

The attributes were exported as a .csv file, which was sorted,
attributes were trimmed (i.e., some attributes were removed), and then
the results were saved as CW dominated polygons trimmed.xlsx. Three of
these stands in the northwestern part of MKRF were selected as stands of
interest (CW dominated three polygons trimmed.xlsx). A few of the
attributes of these polygons are shown in Table~\ref{tbl-polys}, and an
image of the location of these stands is shown in Figure 1

In the CW dominated three polygons \textbf{trimmed.xlsx} file, you will
also find the species percentages for these three selected polygons, and
other attributes that you may need as inputs to VDYP to forecast this
stand. Using VDYP, forecast these three stands from 0 to 250 years total
age at 10-year intervals. You will get a yield a yield trajectory for
each attribute in each of three stands (i.e., total volume per ha,
merchantable volume per ha, stems per ha, etc. over time).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  To get you started, first do the example stand in the Quick Intro to
  VDYP7.pdf (or .docx) file to get the yield trajectory, export these to
  EXCEL, trim off any labels, and then graphs the trajectories.
\item
  Use similar steps to get forecasts for each of these three stands, and
  export growth and yield table to an EXCEL file. Include merchantable
  volume (12.5 + cm DBH) in your outputs, as well as the MAI's for total
  and merchantable volume. (See POLYGON1 2020 VDYP trimmed.xlsx as an
  example of VDYP outputs for a stand).
\item
  Using these growth and yield outputs, answer the questions posed and
  put these answers in your submission

  Repeat \#2, but this time use the merchantable volume per ha (i.e.,

\item
  For each stand, what is the merchantable volume per ha (12.5 cm + DBH)
  at the biological rotation age (i.e., at the maximum m.a.i. for this
  volume)?~ What is the average tree size in terms of average height
  (here Lorey's height) and average DBH (here Quadratic Mean DBH)?
\item
  For each stand, what is current, estimated merchantable volume (12.5
  cm + DBH) for the entire stand? HINT: First, determine the stand age
  as of 2014 using the VRI polygon attributes, and adjust this age to
  current year (2024) Then, look up the merchantable volume per ha (12.5
  cm+ DBH) for that stand age. Finally, determine the current
  merchantable volume for the entire stand.
\item
  Based on the information you now have, would you recommend that any of
  these stands be harvested in the next 10 years or not? Explain your

\section{Task 2 - Forecasting Using
TIPSY}\label{task-2---forecasting-using-tipsy}}

If these stands were harvested, we would need to forecast the stands
again post-harvest. This is less complicated if stands were clearcut
(i.e., called a \emph{regeneration cut} or \emph{clearfelling} in some
places in the world), than if the stands were partially harvested.~ We
will assume that each of these stands was clearcut and you want to
project the stands after harvest.~ Following harvest:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  We could assume that the stands will naturally follow the \ul{same
  trajectory} as prior to harvest, meaning that they will start again at
  total age = 0 and follow the VDYP trajectories you created in Part I.~
\item
  Alternatively, we could plant the pre-harvest dominant species or a
  different species, control the planting density, and forecast each
  stand using this management regime. We would then forecast the stand
  using TIPSY.
\end{itemize}

Here, we will assume that \ul{\textbf{you will plant 1600 stems/ha of
Coastal Douglas-fir following harvest}}. For each stand, show the
\ul{\textbf{forecast trajectories from 0 to 150 years by 10-year
intervals},} as you did previously for the existing stand using VDYP,
but this time using TIPSY for ``managed'' stands.~ You will need to use
some of the VRI information from the old stand that was there prior to
harvest in doing the trajectory (e.g., Site Index).~ Before you do these
stand forecasts, \ul{\textbf{do the forecast for the example stand}} in
the \textbf{Quick Guide to Using TIPSY 4.4.docx (}or pdf).

\hypertarget{question-2-tipsy-questions}{%
\subsection{Question 2 (TIPSY
Questions)}\label{question-2-tipsy-questions}}

Using EXCEL and the outputs from your VDYP and TIPSY forecasts:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  For the post-harvest plan, 1600 stems/ha was used. What is the spacing
  between the trees (m) assuming square spacing? Show your calculations.
\item
  Coastal Douglas-fir (FD) was used as the species to be planted
  post-harvest, whereas CW was the main species in the original stands
  at the time of the VRI inventory (Reference year: 1999). Since the
  Site Index was for CW not for FD, is the TIPSY forecast reliable?
  Explain briefly, considering the ecology of these three species in
  CWH.
\item
  Graph the total volume per ha (m\textsuperscript{3}/ha) over total age
  (years) for the post-harvest TIPSY forecast versus the VDYP forecast
  for each of these stands (NOTE: The TIPSY forecast will be for 0 to
  150 years only).~ Compare these trajectories, and explain why they are
  different using principles of stand and tree growth for the existing
  stand versus the post-harvest planted stand.
\item
  Is the cost of planting justified? Briefly discuss under what
  circumstances this cost would be justified for these three stands.
