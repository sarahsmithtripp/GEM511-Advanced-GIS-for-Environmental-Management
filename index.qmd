# Welcome {.unnumbered}

These are the course materials for FRST 556 - Land Information Acquisition and Analysis. A course taught as part of the Masters in Forest Resources Management (MSFM) in the Faculty of Forestry at UBC. This course covers critical elements for accreditation by the Association of British Columbia Forest Professionals (ABCFP) and by the Society of American Foresters (SAF). The **six modules** of this course cover **XX** key knowledge concepts including:

-   Concept a

-   Concept b

-   Concept c

-   Concept d

-   Concept e

-   Concept f

This web-page hosts lab assignments that students enrolled in FRST 556 must complete for credit. **Note that much of the data referenced are either public datasets or otherwise only available to students enrolled in the course for credit**. Deliverables for these assignments are submitted through the UBC learning management system and only students enrolled in the course may submit these assignments for credit.

## How to use these resources {.unnumbered}

Each "module" is a standalone lab assignment designed to be completed over one or two weeks.

Students enrolled in FRST 556 will submit all deliverables through via the UBC course management system (canvas). Deadlines and submission locations can be found on canvas. The casual user can still complete the tutorials step-by-step, but not all data are publicly available nor are hosted on this website. Therefore a casual user may have issues completing all modules.
